2. You can kill people who are inside your property after **<u>2 warnings</u>** if they are not leaving or making an attempt to leave.
3. You are allowed to **<u>KOS at envoys</u>** when someone is obviously going for an envoy, if someone is just going past because it’s in a public area then do not KOS them.
4. You are allowed to KOS people who are partaking in the **<u>theft of a car</u>** (with the car heist plugin).
5. To kill a PD in a situation they must be **<u>making an attempt to arrest you</u>**. This is mainly just them asking for you to put your hands up. You **<u>must negotiate with PD if you have a hostage</u>**, you cannot KOS.
